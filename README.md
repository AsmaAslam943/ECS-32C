# ECS-32C
This repository includes a variety of C/C++ projects that I have created. These projects reflect the different skills within C and C++ that I learned throughout Fall 2023. Each project has a highly integrated data structure as each project requires critical thinking skills and quick problem solving abilities to tackle the difficulties. 

# Algorithm Projects 
# Overview 

This repository contains four distinct projects focused on implementing and working with common data structures and algorithms. The projects aim to showcase fundamental computer science concepts, including tree structures and sorting algorithms, implemented in C. These implementations are key building blocks for more complex systems and are optimized for performance and ease of understanding.

Projects in this Repository:
Homework 1 - Dynamic Array: Implementation of a dynamic array structure, including operations such as insertion and deletion. 
Homework 2 Tree: General tree implementation, with the capability to manage multi-child nodes and various traversal techniques.
Homework 3 Sorter: A project focused on implementing various sorting algorithms, including bubble sort, quicksort, merge sort, and insertion sort.
Homework 4 - Binary Tree: Implementation of a binary tree data structure, including operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
